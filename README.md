# Pulse-Shaping-and-Matched-Filtering

Generating a string of message bits.

Use root rasied cosine pulse p(t) as the shapig pulse, and generate the corresponding baseband signal with a fixed bit duration Tb. You may use
roll-off factor as Î± = 0.4.

Simulate transmission of baseband signal via an AWGN channel

Eye diagram simulation also included (change the roll off facctor and run the program
